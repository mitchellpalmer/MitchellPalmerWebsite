                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    I am passionate about economics, politics, and technology. In particular,
                    I believe in the power of private enterprise, decentralised decision-making,
                    and stable institutions to deliver prosperity and freedom.
                </p>
                <p>My experience ranges from policy analysis to software development to content production. In politics,
                    I pride myself on building force-multiplier software, which allows small teams to achieve big results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking for opportunities in the commercial sector to
                    apply my analytical and technical skills in new industries.
                    I am also available to assist not-for-profits, advocacy groups,
                    and political parties looking to achieve change.
                    I am based in Singapore, but I do not work on partisan political activity here.
                    I was raised in New Zealand and am available to work remotely.

                    <p>I was employed full-time in the parliamentary
