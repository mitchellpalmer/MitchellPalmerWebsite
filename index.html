                <h2>About Mitchell</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    I am a BA (Hons) candidate at Yale-NUS College, a highly selective liberal arts college in Singapore.
                    I am passionate about economics, politics, and technology. In particular,
                    I believe in the power of private enterprise, decentralised decision-making,
                    and stable institutions to deliver prosperity and freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience includes developing and costing economic policy for a political party during a General Election, 
                    writing mission-critical software for a large logistics company, researching the private equity industry for an 
                    international think tank, and coaching collegiate and schools debating. I also occassionally write 
                    <a href="https://mitchellpalmer.github.io">a blog</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am always open for opportunities in the commercial sector to
                    apply my analytical and technical skills in new industries.
                    I am also available to assist not-for-profits, advocacy groups,
                    and market-oriented political parties looking to achieve change.
                    I am based in Singapore, but I do not work on partisan political activity here.
                    I was raised in New Zealand and am available to work remotely.
                </p>
